        Hi there! My full name is Artur, but you can call me Art. I am a Polish-American who spent my life growing up between Europe and Oregon.
        After graduating from high school in the United States, I moved back to Poland to strengthen my skills in Polish. I used this time as
        a gap year before college, my intent being to think more seriously about what I wanted to pursue as a career.
         I opted for a degree in psychology, and graduated from Oregon State University in 2016. Directly after 
        obtaining my undergraduate degree, I took another gap year and moved to Madrid, Spain. I worked as an English teacher to kids, and 
        taught myself Spanish through language-exchange. During my time away from Oregon, I thought about what master
        programs I wanted to attend in the future, but ultimately couldn't decide. I moved back to Oregon at the end of 2017
        and managed a dental office while taking premed classes at the University of Oregon. After the pandemic hit, I connected with a good friend who works in cybersecurity.
        After much deliberation and talking with him, I decided to search for a coding school and change my career. That's when I stumbled
        upon Epicodus, decided to enroll and begin my pursuit as a software engineer!
